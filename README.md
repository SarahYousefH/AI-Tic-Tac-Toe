# AI-Tic-Tac-Toe Project

## Overview

This project is a Tic-Tac-Toe game developed using Java 19 and JavaFX, featuring an unbeatable AI powered by the Minimax algorithm. The AI ensures that the computer always plays optimally, making the game challenging for human players.

## Features

1. **Two-Player Mode**: 
   - Allows two human players to play against each other on the same system.

2. **Unbeatable AI (Minimax Algorithm)**: 
   - The AI uses the Minimax algorithm to evaluate all possible game states and make the most optimal move, ensuring that it either wins or forces a draw, making it impossible to defeat.

## Game Scenarios

- **Two-Player Mode**: Allows two human players to compete by taking turns.
- **Minimax AI**: The AI evaluates every possible move, predicting the outcome of each to determine the best strategy. It is designed to make perfect moves based on the current board state, providing an unbeatable challenge.

## Key Requirements

- The game features an **intuitive and interactive graphical interface** built with JavaFX.
- For human vs. AI matches, the game will clearly display messages indicating which player is making a move, along with the AI's thought process during decision-making.
- The number of rounds played and the current score will be updated and displayed in real-time.
